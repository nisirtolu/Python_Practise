Return the target array.It is guaranteed that the insertion operations will be valid.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","Input: nums = [0,1,2,3,4], index = [0,1,2,2,1]\n","\n","Output: [0,4,1,3,2]\n","\n","Explanation: nums index target 0 0 [0] 1 1 [0,1] 2 2 [0,1,2] 3 2 [0,1,3,2] 4 1 [0,4,1,3,2]"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def target_array(nums, index):\n","    target = []\n","    for i in range(len(nums)):\n","        target.insert(index[i], nums[i])\n","    return target\n","\n","nums = [0,1,2,3,4]\n","index = [0,1,2,2,1]\n","print(target_array(nums, index))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"FRTkkp3zChpa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1690171093264,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":235,"user":{"displayName":"Mustafa Demir","userId":"06051334507014776726"}},"outputId":"fc2b707a-f136-400f-e189-f11534765ba7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[0, 4, 1, 3, 2]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"iK2inSclpCJY"},"source":["Q.15.
